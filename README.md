### 1、`slug`是什么？

引用 [What is: Post Slug](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/post-slug/) 上的一段话  
The `post slug` is the user friendly and URL valid name of a post. Most common usage of this feature is to create a permalink(永久链接) for each post.

If the post title is really long or it changes often then a post slug can be especially useful.

Once it is defined and the post is published, the post slug should not be changed. If it is changed then the same content will be published on multiple pages and any links to your older page will be broken because the permalink to your post will now be different.
